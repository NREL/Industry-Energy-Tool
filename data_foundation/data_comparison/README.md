## Comparing IET Foundational Data
IET county-level data are built on estimates of energy use calculated 
from facility-level greenhouse gas emissions data. The most 
geographically-resolved publicly available data is the 
Energy Information Administration's Manufacturing Energy Consumption 
Survey (MECS), which is reported at the census region (i.e., Northeast, 
South, Midwest, and West). Although MECS contains data at the six-digit 
NAICS level, not all manufacturing NAICS codes are disaggregated to this 
level.
