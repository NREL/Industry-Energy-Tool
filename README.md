# Industry-Energy-Tool (IET)
The Industry Energy Tool (IET) is a calculator for projecting energy efficiency and fuel switching scenarios for the U.S. industrial sector energy use and emissions at the Census Region and county-level. The IET is built on a foundation of county-level industry end use data primarily derived from facility-level emissions data and the U.S. Energy Information Administration's 2010 Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey.
The IET is currently comprised of modules for calculating stock turnover, and implementing changes to energy efficiency and industry energy fuel mix (i.e., fuel switching).
